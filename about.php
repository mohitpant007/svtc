                                We support economically poor students ,but not students who are academically POOR. Educational scholarship is only given to students who are hardworking, diligent, meticulous, consistent and have a purpose of performance in life. Preference for this offer is for BRAHMINS – Madhwa’s / Smartha’s / Vyshnav’s. We also honour poor students who have secured 90% & above in any Board Exam,with a PRATHIBA PURASKARA AWARD
